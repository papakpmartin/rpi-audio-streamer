# rpi-audio-streamer

## What am I trying to do here?

I'd like to be able to set up a Raspeberry Pi (presuming Rev 3, but perhaps Zero would do it?) to do the following:

* Be able to stream live audio on the LAN
* Be able to stream that same live audio to a Shoutcast feed
* Auto-start everything on power-up
* Not have hideous things happen when the power is unceremoniously lost

I've gotten very close, and I don't think this repo represents my latest. I started to have some trouble with Docker and so kept slogging along just on the Raspi itself.
